/*
Q10.Given the heights of N towers and a value of K, Either increase or 
decrease the height of every tower by K (only once) where K > 0. After 
modifications, the task is to minimize the difference between the heights 
of the longest and the shortest tower and output its difference.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
Output:  Minimum difference is 5.
Explanation: Change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5 
(between 4 and 9). We can’t get a lower difference.
