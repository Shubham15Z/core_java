Q1 Why array index start with zero
Ans:

zero based numbering comes from language design itself.
In C an array points to the location in memory, so in 
expression array[n], n should not be treated as an index,
but as an offset from the arrayâ€™s head

Ex

Array address: 0x7ffe9472bad0
Array[0] = 0x7ffe9472bad0
Array[1] = 0x7ffe9472bad4
Array[2] = 0x7ffe9472bad8
Array[3] = 0x7ffe9472badc
Array[4] = 0x7ffe9472bae0
Array[5] = 0x7ffe9472bae4

the first element and the array itself points to the same 
memory location, so it is 0 elements away from the location 
of the array itself.
